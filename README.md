SearchTree

In computer science, a search tree is a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set. 
In order for a tree to function as a search tree, the key for each node must be greater than any keys in subtrees on the left, 
and less than any keys in subtrees on the right.


Inorder, Preorder, Postoder

The major importance of tree traversal is that there are multiple ways of carrying out traversal operations unlike linear data 
 like arrays, bitmaps, matrices where traversal is done in a linear order.

Each of these methods of traversing a tree have a particular order they follow:

For Inorder, you traverse from the left subtree to the root then to the right subtree.
For Preorder, you traverse from the root to the left subtree then to the right subtree.
For Post order, you traverse from the left subtree to the right subtree then to the root.

Level-Order traversal

A Level Order Traversal is a traversal which always traverses based on the level of the tree.

So, this traversal first traverses the nodes corresponding to Level 0, and then Level 1, and so on, from the root node.
